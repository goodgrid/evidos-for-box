# Evidos for Box

Evidos for Box is an integration between Evidos' Signhost service and Box. Signhost is a service to have documents signed in various ways. Box is a cloud content services platform. Evidos offers a variety of signing methods. Some of the method are aimed on the Dutch market, since they are Dutch standards like DigiD, iDeal, IDIN and eHerkenning. But Evidos also supports advanced and qualified electronic signatures, like Itsme.

Current status of this project is proof of concept. The integration works, but additional work is needed for error handling, user interface and testing.
